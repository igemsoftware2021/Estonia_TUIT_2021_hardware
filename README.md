## Overview
Our team devised an innovative method of preventive dental care. The method includes the use of an engineered protease to cleave the human SALSA protein that is used by cariogenic bacteria to attach to the teeth. For this, we needed a way of applying the protease in the mouth. We conducted a survey among potential users to find the preferred way of applying our product. The survey results showed that delivery in the form of a spray is one of the most popular preferences. This drove us to create our in-house designed and produced spray - PAPIC ( Protease Assured Plaque Internal Cleaner )

## In this repository you can find all the 3D models and drawing of our spray.
